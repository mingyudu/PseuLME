Title: Differential Expression Analysis Using Pseudobulk and Linear Mixed-Effects Models on Single-Cell Omics Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mingyu Du
Maintainer: Mingyu Du <mingyd1@uci.edu>
Description: PseuLME provides a streamlined workflow for differential expression (DE) analysis in single-cell omics data. 
  The package facilitates the creation of pseudobulk datasets, gene and sample filtering, and performs DE 
  analysis using linear mixed-effects models (LME) to account for batch effects. 
  Key features include subclustering of cell types, pseudobulk conversion, gene and sample filtering, and statistical 
  testing with post-hoc comparisons.
